This project visualizes Chapman reference transaction data in several ways supplementary to the capabilities of LibAnswers analytics.

All cleaning, filtering, and visualization code is contained in the Marimo notebook, which can be run as a web app to allow for easy data exploration.

Considerations for non-Chapman reuse: the only hardcoded filter is a READ level value. If you do not use READ levels in your reference logging, this will not work for you, but you can easily edit these parts of the code out if desired.
